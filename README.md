# KASA

Kasa is a web application of an accomodation rental platform C2C.
It is just a prototype so you can't do a fake booking and you can't see the price. 
But I'm working on a v2, more fonctionnal.

In this project developted in a formation, I had the chance to work with a designer to develop my skills.
I used reausable component and trained me to write code cleanest as I could.

You can see the result on vercel : https://kasa-eta.vercel.app/
